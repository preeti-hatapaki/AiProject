Color Flood Game Overview
Welcome to the Color Flood Game! The goal is to flood the entire grid with a single color in as few moves as possible.
Game Objective:
Start from the top-left corner of the grid and gradually flood the entire grid with one color by selecting new colors. Each move changes the color of the top-left corner and any adjacent cells of the same color.
How to Play:
At the beginning of the game, the grid is randomly filled with different colors.
You can select a color using the color buttons below the grid.
When you select a color, all connected cells of the same color starting from the top-left corner will change to your selected color.
Continue selecting colors until the entire grid is filled with one color or you run out of moves.
Rules:
You have a maximum of 25 moves to flood the entire grid.
If you flood the grid within the move limit, you win! If not, the game ends.
